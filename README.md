**This is my first pass at a C# application and I have a lot of areas where I can improve upon including:**

 - [ ] creating order seed data in my data layer
 - [ ] figuring out how to "connect" my service layer to my react application. I tried a lot of different things but I just don't understand how the route work exactly. In its current state I can't edit any orders or process any, only look at my sad data
 - [ ]  Improving my tests. I ran into a lot of problems trying to write a simple test following an example and still had issues
